What is this project for?
This is a self-initiated project to audit lodging charges based on my required tasks for my company. All file names have been removed.
This code involves finding errors in data and correcting information for further auditing with external data from a database.
The code does not fully automate the process because of the requirement of an external database.

Why did I create this?
There was an issue with time and auditing charges due to sheer amount of data and inconsistencies. This code helps find and reduce the inconsistencies and data review. Overall, this reduces time from reviewing charges to processing for clients.

What Did I Learn?
Maintaining clean data is necessary to automate any process. It also helps in verification and auditing processes, allowing for a more efficient process. 
The combination of openpyxl and Pandas helped me with this project. This code reduces review time overall and allows for a faster processing to our clients.

What Would I Improve on?
I would like to fully automate the process to an extent but this is also dependent on the data I receive.
As I have researched, I am currently limited based on using formulas with external data. By fixing this issue (outside of the code), I believe I will be able to automate the process.
